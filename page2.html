            I love you bbg. 
            I am so lucky to have you and there's no one else I would like to be spending Valentines Day with. 
            You make me so happy just to be around even through our ups and downs, and I hope I can do the same for you.
            You make everything a lot better just by being there, and I mean that because just having you there means 
            I always have someone with me that I know I love and trust. 
            What I'm really just reiterating is that I love you a lot and I can't wait to spend lots of more days with my BBG.
